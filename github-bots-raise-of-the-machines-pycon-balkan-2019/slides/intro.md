Note: (55s)

We'll start with a few stories.

Imagine: you are in charge of a project.<br>
It's probably hosted on GitHub.<br>
You and your co-maintainers
have to keep it in a good healthy shape.

**Now, what is it that maintainers do?**

A maintainer is a person
who takes care of a project.
They accept other people's patches,
release new versions etc.

So you do various "workflow" activities
on a regular basis. Like:
- triaging new incoming issues,
- replying to comments in a timely manner,
- reviewing Pull Requests and merging them,
- writing docs
- and so on.

You also want to safely evolve the project<br>
so you've got a CI.<br>
It runs your test suite across various supported envs.

Is it enough, though?

Your project becomes bigger<br>
and the volume of routines<br>
is getting unbearable...

Where's all the fun gone?
