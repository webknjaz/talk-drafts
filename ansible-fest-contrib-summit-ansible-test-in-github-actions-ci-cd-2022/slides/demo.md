# Demo

Note: (Xs)

And now, it's time to check out a demo repository I've created from the
collection template repository earlier today.

It's very minimalist and I didn't even add any "proper" collection
content.

I've added an integration test and an example of a matrix-parametrized
GitHub service container use.
