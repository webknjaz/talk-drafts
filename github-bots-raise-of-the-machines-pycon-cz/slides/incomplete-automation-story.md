Note:

Oh,<br>
and this is only the beginning!

Let's see what happens next!

Note:

You've heard (from a friend)<br>
that you can automate more things.<br>
Sounds fun...

</center>

Note:

So you make your CI pipeline to also build and publish your
software whenever a Git tag is created.

<!-- .element: style="border: none; box-shadow: none;" -->
</center>

Note:

Going further,<br>
you don't want to hardcode your software version in a text file.<br>
You set up the build scripts to reuse Git tag for that.

You can now relax and be happy about your little automation project.

Note:

One day,<br>
you integrate a change log generator tool â€”<br>
Towncrier.<br>
Now,<br>
your release workflow became a bit more complicated.<br>
Everyone, who submits a Pull Request,<br>
has to to additionally include a change note.<br>
And now, to do a release,<br>
maintainers should first<br>
manually run Towncrier to create a changelog,<br>
then commit the results<br>
and finally push a Git tag.

Note:

Next day,<br>
another maintainer pushes a new tag.<br>
But he doesn't know about the new release instuctions, yet.

<!-- .element: style="border: none; box-shadow: none;" -->
</center>

Note:

You open your CI/CD!<br>
and try chasing that job which builds and publishes your software!<br>
It's about to release an artifact without a changelog!

Maybe you are lucky<br>
and you've got to be faster than the automation.

Note:

You cancel that job.<br>
You won this race and started quickily cleaning up the mess.<br>
You hope nobody noticed that embarrassing tag in the Git tree!<br>
Phew...! That was close!

Note:

But maybe not.<br>
Maybe the automation got faster than you and published that<br>
incomplete artifact.

</center>

Note:

Oops!<br>
You'll have to do things properly now and publish a post-release.

By now, you must've realized<br>
that incomplete automation may be misleading.<br>
It can probably be more harmful to have incomplete automation<br>
than not to have it at all.

Note:

Partial automation of multi-step processes is still quite
vulnerable to human errors.

Note:

Automate all parts of your workflow so that nothing would be forgotten!
